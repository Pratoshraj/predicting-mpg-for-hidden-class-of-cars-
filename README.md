# predicting-mpg-for-hidden-class-of-cars-
Clustering the cars based on its hidden class and applying linear regression to predict their mpg(miles per gallon) 

I have used non-hierarchial clustering method (k-means) for grouping.

The dataset is uploaded in the repository, 'cars.csv'.

.ipynb file has the entire code for this project.


ABOUT DATA-

The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 2 multivalued discrete and 4 continuous variables.

Attribute Information:

Car Name – Name of the car

Cyl – No of cylinders in the car – Multivalued discrete

Disp – Displacement – continuous

Hp – Horsepower – continuous

Wt – Weight – continuous

Acc – Accleration – continuous

Yr – Model of the car – Multivalued discrete
